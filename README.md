##### NOTE:

I have a custom domain connected to GitHub, so my GitHub Pages repositories
do not follow the usual GITHUB-USERNAME-HERE.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME-HERE format.
If the domain fails for some reason, you can still access my site by going to
[https://redman1037.github.io/](https://redman1037.github.io/)
